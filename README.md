<i> This repository is for tools that I use for gaming sometimes </i>

- AntiMicro 
  - This is a controller remapper 
- Borderless Gaming 
  - This app takes games that normally open in windowed mode and makes them full screen 
  - Mainly for when alt+enter doesn't work as intended for whatever reason
